# 🍔 FreshEats Food Delivery Web App  

FreshEats is a simple food ordering and delivery demo website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It demonstrates form validation, interactive shopping cart functionality, and DOM manipulation.  

## 🚀 Features  

- Interactive Menu: Users can add food items (Burger, Pizza, Salad) to their cart.  
- Dynamic Cart: Items and total price update instantly using JavaScript.  
- Custom Form Validation: Order form checks for:  
  - Empty fields  
  - Valid 10-digit phone number  
  - Non-empty cart before submitting  
- Helpful Feedback: Error or success messages are displayed clearly.  
- Clean UI/UX: Styled with CSS for a modern and simple look.  

## 📂 Project Structure  

 How It Works  

1. **Add Items to Cart**  
   - Click **"Add to Cart"** on any menu item.  
   - The item appears in the cart list, and the total updates.  

2. **Fill the Order Form**  
   - Enter **Name**, **Delivery Address**, and **Phone Number**.  
   - Phone number must be **10 digits** (basic validation).  

3. **Submit the Form**  
   - If any validation fails, a helpful **error message** is shown.  
   - If everything is correct, a **success message** appears and the cart resets.

## 💻 Technologies Used  

- **HTML5** – structure of the page.  
- **CSS3** – styling, layout, and visual design.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – interactivity, form validation, and dynamic cart.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  

This project demonstrates:  
- Handling events (`click`, `submit`).  
- DOM manipulation (adding/removing/updating elements dynamically).  
- Writing custom form validation (without relying only on HTML5 `required`).  
- Using arrays and loops for cart management.

## 📝 Future Improvements  

- Add remove item functionality in the cart.  
- Save cart data using localStorage.  
- Add more food items with images.  
- Connect to a backend for real order processing.
